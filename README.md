# Sign Language Interpeter that translate hand gestures into spoken language (English) using Leap Motion Sensors Dataset from Kaggle

## Motivation:
* Sign Language is one of the commonly used languages in the USA (Ref 1)

* Sign Language is one of the languages that is hard to understand for spoken language
users without training. Even though it is used by approximately 0.25 million to 0.50
million people in the USA(Ref 2), sign language is considered challenging to learn

* This can be shown by the employment gap of 22.5% between the deaf and hearing
populations (Ref 3)

* Building a tool for individuals to translate sign language into spoken language would add
a lot of value for the sign language users to narrow the employment gap between Sign
Language users and Spoken Language users

* Sign language translation can also help the 0.6 million deaf individuals who require
mental treatment every year (Ref 5)
